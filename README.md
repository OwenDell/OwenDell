# Hi, I'm Owen Dellasega and I'm an 18 year old learning software development.

            
<p>
            I first started learning to code back in 2020 through a beginner level Python course. It was enough to teach me the basics and make me realize my passion for coding.
For the past 3 years I've been casually learning a few different languages on and off, though it's really only been this past year where I've gotten more serious about it.
I've learned some of the basics of C# and used it to dabble around in Unity and to write a text-based RPG that runs in the command line.
I also recently completed a year long Python course in my senior year of highschool and it's what has made me go from casually learning to code to aiming to become a software developer!</p>

<p>I only just started using GitHub, but I went back and uploaded some of the programs I've written over the years that I'm most proud of, as a way of documenting and showcasing my learning.
I have base level knowledge of Python and C#, and am currently most interested in learning these two languages.</p>
